Compiling and installing SCALAPACKFX
====================================

In order to compile SCALAPACKFX, you need following prerequisites:

* Fortran 2003 compiler [*]_,

* GNU M4 macro interpreter,

* GNU Make.

There are basically two different ways of using the library in your project:

* `Precompiling the library`_ and linking it later to your project.

* `Compiling the library during your build process`_.

Both are described below.


Precompiling the library
************************

In order to create a precompiled library

#. Copy the file `make.arch.template` to `make.arch` in the root directory of
   the source and customize the settings for the compilers and the linker
   according to your system.

#. Change to the `src/` folder.

#. Issue `make` to build the library.

#. Copy *all* module files (usually ending on `.mod` and the library
   `libscalapackfx.a` to a place, where your Fortran compiler and your linker
   can recognize them.

During the build process of your project, you may link the library with the
`-lscalapackfx` option.  Eventually, you may need to specify options for your
compiler and your linker to specify the location of those directories. Assuming
you've put the module files in the directory `<MODFILEDIR>` and the library file
in `<LIBRARYDIR>`, you would typically invoke your compiler for the source files
using the `libscalapackfx_module` as::

    F2003_COMPILER -I<MODFILEDIR> -c somesource.f90

and link your object files at the end with::

    LINKER -I<LIBRARYDIR> somesource.o ... -L<LIBRARYDIR> -lscalapackfx


Compiling the library during your build process
***********************************************

In order to build the library during the build process of your project:

#. Copy the content of the `src/` folder into a *separate* folder within your
   project.

#. During the make process of your project, invoke the library makefile
   (`Makefile.lib`) to build the module files and the library in the folder
   where you've put the library sources.

   You must pass the compiler and linker options via variable defintions at the
   make command line. Assuming that the variables `$(FXX)`, `$(FXXOPT)`, `$(LN)`
   and `$(LNOPT)`, `$(M4)` and `$(M4OPT)` contain the Fortran compiler, the
   Fortran compiler options, the linker, the linker options, the M4 preprocessor
   and its options, respectively, you would have something like::

       $(SCALAPACKFX_SRCDIR)/libscalapackfx.a:
               $(MAKE) -C $(SCALAPACKFX_SRCDIR) \
                   FXX="$(FXX)" FXXOPT="$(FXXOPT)" \
                   LN="$(LN)" LNOPT="$(LNOPT)" \
                   M4="$(M4)" M4OPT="$(M4OPT)" \
                   -f Makefile.lib

   in the makefile of your project with `$(SCALAPACKFX_SRCDIR)` being the
   directory where you've put the source of SCALAPACKFX.

You should also have a look at the `GNUmakefile` in the `test/` folder of
SCALAPACKFX, which uses exactly the same technique to compile the library during
the build process for the tests.


.. [*] GNU Fortran 4.9 (earlier versions may not work!), NAG Fortran 5.3.1 and
       Intel Fortran 12.1 seem to work.
